The administrator can:

● Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes
● Set up a master list of all the teachers
● Set up a master list of all the classes
● Assign classes for subjects from the master list
● Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
